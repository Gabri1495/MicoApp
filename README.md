# MicoApp
An Android application to support who likes to search mushrooms.

This app has born in 2019 as a project for the course of 
[Laboratorio di Applicazioni Mobili](https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2018/367016) 
at University of Bologna, but the focus was already to do something more.

If you like to search mushrooms like me this app could help you to keep a personal record of 
which moushrooms, where have you found them and eventually share these finds with your friends 
(I know how gelous is a searcher, so there is no possibility to share online your informations).

## How to install
Obviously you can fork or copy the entire project to build it yourself, but if you are interested
only to the final application, [here](MicoApp) you can find apk.

## License
Please take a look at **open source license**.  
More than an exam these application has been and will be a pleasure (I will continue to work in spare time);
when it will be completed, I will publish it on PlayStore for free,
without ads and eventually with a donation options.  
Feel free to copy, modify and redistribute these code, but I would like that it remains free, open and without ads.

## Contacts
You can contact me on *Telegram* or with an *e-mail*. 
An option inside app allows to enter in contact with me in a fast way (just a couple of tap).

## Notes
At the moment app is absolutely not complete, it lacks of some features and optimization (obiously it 
is not harmful for you smartphone or for data saved on it).
